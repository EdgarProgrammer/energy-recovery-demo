# energy-recovery-demo
This project is an HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype that visualizes trends in energy recovery from trucks. Users can adjust the number of trucks, their weight, and speed to see how total “energy recovered” changes over time. This simplified model is inspired by Alfons Huber's work at REPS.
